  The Apple II was part of something called the Holy Trinity. It was one of the 3 main computers that competed in the market at the time along with the Commodore PET and the TRS-80 Model I. <BR>

The Commodore PET was built by a company called Commodore, which started as a typewriter repair company in 1954 by Auschwitz survivor Jack Tramiel. The PET had its own built-in monitor, keyboard, and tape drive and gave early computer users everything they needed to start working. It even had a version of BASIC purchased from Bill Gates' tiny Micro-Soft company. They managed to sell over 4000 PETs in 1978 with their base model PET selling for $795. <BR>
At the time, Radioshack also decided to go into the personal computer business. They put the Tandy-Radio Shack 80 (TRS-80) model on the market and sold it in modular form. The computer along with the keyboard was sold for $399 and the monitor and casette storage system were sold seperately for $199 and $49 respectively. At first the company gave each of their 3000 stores one unit each to sell. They got over 10,000 orders in the first month and it soon became the top selling personal computer on the market. <BR>
The Apple II computer was retailed for $1,298 with 4k of RAM, or $1,698 with 16k. At first the sales were slow. They only sold 600 computers in 1977, mostly because of its higher price compared to the PET and the TRS-80. Though after the addition of the fast and relatively cheap disk, the sales took off and 7600 units were sold in 1978 and 35000 units were sold in 1979. Even though the sales increased drastically at this point, Apple was still behind the other two computers in the trinity concerning sales.<A
