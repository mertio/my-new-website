Conclusion</A>
</H1>
 Since its founding in 1977 up until today, Apple has been through a lot and has a very rich history. Though they had some very good ideas, ground-breaking innovations and top quality products, their business strategies and the way they marketed themselves made made all the difference. With the influence of great and creative minds such as Steve Jobs, they have managed to become one of the largest and most well known company in the world and have made an impact on countless people world wide.
<BR>
In this paper we took a look at various moments in Apple history and tried to analyze just what Apple did that brought them to success. We saw them take previously failed technologies and somehow push them to be mainstream like the graphical user interface with the Macintosh. We saw how a computer program exclusive to the Apple II, Visicalc, aside from helping Apple sell more products changed the way businesses viewed computers and even changed the job market and paved the way for the development of advanced statistics and artificial intelligence, which is currently one of the most important technologies in our era. We looked at how creating a product ecosystem with the iPod and the iTunes helped increase product sales drastically. We saw how iPhones made the economies of entire countries dependent on Apple and how Apple used a sourcing strategy to buy components and materials for their products from all around the world, even from rivals like Samsung or LG to reach a very high profit margin. We observed just how large Apple has become by making comparisons in GDP and growth not with other companies but with actual countries.

I tried to cover as much as I could in the scope of this paper but the truth is Apple is a 42 year old company as of 2018 and there are still a lot of things we couldn't get into. Delving into some of the more critical moments I hope I have succeeded in showing some of the business strategies that have shaped Apple into the giant company that it is today. I have learned a lot about what it took and what decisions had to be made in order to make a company grow and I also learned a lot on how a company like Apple can have an impact on the various aspects of the economy, both on a local and a global level.
