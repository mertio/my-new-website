iPhones Responsible for 10% of U.S. Economic Growth</A>
</H3>
 In late 2014, Forbes reported of a claim that Apple's iPhone 6 Plus sales were responsible for 10% of all US economic growth.<A
 HREF="#iphoneUSEconomy">()</A> Quoting an article about the situation, here is how they came to the conclusion: <BR>
<BR>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit"> Based on pure mathematical estimates of the productive value of all final American products, as well as the revenue generated from iPhone 6 sales, the Apple device was seemingly responsible for 0.25% or 0.3% of the change in the United States' GDP. On the surface, this meant iPhone 6 sales were 10 to 15% of conventional economic growth.
<BR>
GDP is actually a very rough, overly simplistic, and problematic estimate of growth. Moreover, revenue from iPhone sales is not the same as a domestic product from iPhone sales, since domestic product tries to capture value added, not just incoming dollars. Even if that statistic is wrong (which Forbes admits, it probably is), 10% is still an interesting figure to express how huge Apple's sales numbers were&#226;&#128;&#148;even back in 2014.<A
