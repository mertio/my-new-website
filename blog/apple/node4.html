Before we begin analyzing Apple's products and services and their general economical impacts, it would be nice to shortly go over who Apple are and briefly sum up their history in order to put everything we will discuss in this paper into perspective. <BR>
It all started on the 1st of April in the year 1976 by two college dropouts Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs. The goal of Wozniak and Jobs was to create a small user-friendly computer that people could have in their own homes or their offices. There was originally a third co-founder of the company, Ronald Wayne, with 10% of shares but after twelve days he sold his share to Steve Wozniak for $800. <A

The first product they built was the Apple One Computer. They built it in their garage and publicly displayed it at the Homebrew Computer Club, a group of computer hobbyists in Silicon Valley. Soon after, Steve Jobs convinced Steve Wozniak to start building more of these and selling them. And so began their adventure...
<BR>
Apple is now a multinational technology company whose headquarters are in Cupertino, California. They design, develop and sell consumer electronics, computer software and online services. They are best known for their series of desktop computers, laptops and mobile phones. They have also been influential in other areas like the music industry with iTunes and the iPod and have been a leading innovative force in technology, for example building the first commercially successful computer to use a graphical user interface and helping it become a mainstream technology, or introducing the world to Visicalc, the first computer spreadsheet program. We will try to cover these and many more in this paper. <BR>
Apple has slowly grown into one of the largest companies in the world, being the first company to hit the 1 trillion dollar mark in market capitalization<A NAME="tex2html2"
