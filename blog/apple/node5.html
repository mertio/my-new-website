<P>
The history of Apple is very a very rich one and is filled with events, good and bad, that can help us understand the importance of some of the strategies and decision making in businesses and how they can have crucial effects on the company and even on the economy as a whole.
<BR>
My aim is to travel back to some of the crucial moments of Apple's history and take a look at what made Apple the company it is today. We will observe and analyze several products that have managed to captivate a very large customer base and several events that have both shaped the future of the company. We will also see how the economy of the United States and other countries has been affected by the actions of this company.
