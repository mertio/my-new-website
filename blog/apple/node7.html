Steve Wozniak was an Engineer working for Hewlett-Packard and wanted his own personal computer to play around with. He had already been designing it for years and after being encouraged from other computers entering the market, he decided to finally build it. <BR>
He then decided to take his computer and show it at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto California. His friend and fellow club member Steve Jobs loved it and helped make a few improvements. He convinced Wozniak to build and sell some of these computers and make some money.<A

<P>
In total there were about 200 computers made and about 175 of them were sold in the first 8-9 months. Later on when the Apple II was built, they took in old Apple One computers from their customers for the new one and destroyed them to make them very rare. In 2013, one of these computers in working condition was sold in an auction for the price of $671400. <A
