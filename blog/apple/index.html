<P>
This is a paper that has been written for my Engineering Economics class. In this paper I will be analyzing different critical moments and products in Apple's history and what their impact has been to the Company and the Economy as a whole. I will also be explaining what kind of business strategies Apple has used over the years to become the successful tech giant that it is.

Before we begin analyzing Apple's products and services and their general economical impacts, it would be nice to shortly go over who Apple are and briefly sum up their history in order to put everything we will discuss in this paper into perspective. <BR>
  It all started on the 1st of April in the year 1976 by two college dropouts Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs. The goal of Wozniak and Jobs was to create a small user-friendly computer that people could have in their own homes or their offices. There was originally a third co-founder of the company, Ronald Wayne, with 10% of shares but after twelve days he sold his share to Steve Wozniak for $800. <A
 HREF="#ronaldWayne">()</A> <BR>
  The first product they built was the Apple One Computer. They built it in their garage and publicly displayed it at the Homebrew Computer Club, a group of computer hobbyists in Silicon Valley. Soon after, Steve Jobs convinced Steve Wozniak to start building more of these and selling them. And so began their adventure...<BR>
  Apple is now a multinational technology company whose headquarters are in Cupertino, California. They design, develop and sell consumer electronics, computer software and online services. They are best known for their series of desktop computers, laptops and mobile phones. They have also been influential in other areas like the music industry with iTunes and the iPod and have been a leading innovative force in technology, for example building the first commercially successful computer to use a graphical user interface and helping it become a mainstream technology, or introducing the world to Visicalc, the first computer spreadsheet program. We will try to cover these and many more in this paper. <BR>
 Apple has slowly grown into one of the largest companies in the world, being the first company to hit the 1 trillion dollar mark in market capitalization<A NAME="tex2html2"

<P>
The history of Apple is very a very rich one and is filled with events, good and bad, that can help us understand the importance of some of the strategies and decision making in businesses and how they can have crucial effects on the company and even on the economy as a whole.
<BR>
  My aim is to travel back to some of the crucial moments of Apple's history and take a look at what made Apple the company it is today. We will observe and analyze several products that have managed to captivate a very large customer base and several events that have both shaped the future of the company. We will also see how the economy of the United States and other countries has been affected by the actions of this company.

Steve Wozniak was an Engineer working for Hewlett-Packard and wanted his own personal computer to play around with. He had already been designing it for years and after being encouraged from other computers entering the market, he decided to finally build it. <BR>
  He then decided to take his computer and show it at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto California. His friend and fellow club member Steve Jobs loved it and helped make a few improvements. He convinced Wozniak to build and sell some of these computers and make some money.<A

In total there were about 200 computers made and about 175 of them were sold in the first 8-9 months. Later on when the Apple II was built, they took in old Apple One computers from their customers for the new one and destroyed them to make them very rare. In 2013, one of these computers in working condition was sold in an auction for the price of $671400. <A

Apple One's Sales Among the Others</A>
</H3>
  Compared to the other computers emerging in the market, the Apple One was not even on the radar concerning sales. By the end of 1976, approximately 40,000 computers had been sold, with MITS selling approximately 25%, IMSAI 17%, Processor Technology 8%, and SWTP 8%. There were also a dozen more companies that had a very small number of sales just like Apple. The big leap was yet to come...

Apple II (1977) </A>
</H2>

<P>
After the success of the Apple One Computer, Steve Wozniak got excited and decided to build the second computer, Apple II.  This computer would be the one that would make Apple take off. When it first came out in 1977 it was promoted as "an extraordinary computer for ordinary people". It was a refined version of the Apple I motherboard, with added color, memory capacity, eight expansion slots, and an attractive beige case with a built-in brown keyboard. <A
 HREF="#compMarketShareFigures">()</A> The things in the computer that stood out at the time compared to its rivals was the nice graphical display and the user friendly  design. <BR>

The Holy Trinity</A>

  The Apple II was part of something called the Holy Trinity. It was one of the 3 main computers that competed in the market at the time along with the Commodore PET and the TRS-80 Model I. <BR>

The Commodore PET was built by a company called Commodore, which started as a typewriter repair company in 1954 by Auschwitz survivor Jack Tramiel. The PET had its own built-in monitor, keyboard, and tape drive and gave early computer users everything they needed to start working. It even had a version of BASIC purchased from Bill Gates' tiny Micro-Soft company. They managed to sell over 4000 PETs in 1978 with their base model PET selling for $795. <BR>
  At the time, Radioshack also decided to go into the personal computer business. They put the Tandy-Radio Shack 80 (TRS-80) model on the market and sold it in modular form. The computer along with the keyboard was sold for $399 and the monitor and casette storage system were sold seperately for $199 and $49 respectively. At first the company gave each of their 3000 stores one unit each to sell. They got over 10,000 orders in the first month and it soon became the top selling personal computer on the market. <BR>
  The Apple II computer was retailed for $1,298 with 4k of RAM, or $1,698 with 16k. At first the sales were slow. They only sold 600 computers in 1977, mostly because of its higher price compared to the PET and the TRS-80. Though after the addition of the fast and relatively cheap disk, the sales took off and 7600 units were sold in 1978 and 35000 units were sold in 1979. Even though the sales increased drastically at this point, Apple was still behind the other two computers in the trinity concerning sales.<A

VisiCalc: The first Killer App</A>

On the 2nd of January 1979, Dan Bricklen and Bob Franskton of the company Software Arts, publish a program called Visicalc. This is the first spreadsheet program for the Apple II and is essentially the first "killer app" of personal computers. The $100 program helped transform personal computers from cool to have toys to essential business products. For the first time businesses started to see computers as an important tool to gain productivity and efficiency. Personal computers would cut down the weeks a worker might wait as their company&#226;&#128;&#153;s computer department prepared a report. <BR>
  Visicalc was basically an innovative spreadsheet program that could be used for business production planning and calculating finances. No program like it existed before and companies had to buy $2000 Apple II computers just to be able to use it.<A
 HREF="#visicalc">()</A> Although there was a bit of luck on Apple's part concerning Visicalc. The creator Dan Bricklen only wrote it for Apple II because it was the only computer that was available to him at the time. This program became a huge factor in the sales of the Apple II computer and in 1981, with a combination of great marketing and great luck, the company sold 210,000 units, surpassing the Commodore PET and nearly catching up to the numbers of the TRS-80. <A

Influence of Visicalc and Others on the Job Market</A>
</H3>
  The influence that Visicalc has brought is not only limited to the sales of Apple II computers. As mentioned before, it had a huge impact on business and in the job market as well.  Until the 1980s, manipulating large amounts of data like calculating how higher interest rates changed a company&#226;&#128;&#153;s future profits was time consuming and error prone. Then after personal computers and spreadsheet programs came along (Visicalc in 1979, Lotus 1-2-3 in 1983 and Microsoft Excel a few years later) suddenly you could change one number and instantly recalculate costs, revenues and profits years into the future. Since this development allowed simple bookkeeping tasks to be automated, the bookkeeping jobs started to go into decline and skills in how to handle and analyze these spreadsheets started to be more in demand and professions like accounting, auditing, management analysis and financial management started to take off. Even the eventual rise of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, which are essentially can be seen as very advanced statistical analysis, has been sparked by the emergence of these computer spreadsheet programs. <A

In January of 1984, Apple released the Macintosh computer. At first it had only 128K RAM of memory and this as not found to be enough. 8 months later, they released an updated version that had four times as much memory, 512K RAM. <BR>
  Before the release of the Macintosh, computers were not graphical but text based. You could only operate the computer by typing words onto it. The Macintosh could be used by clicking on pictures (icons) on the screen with a small device called a "mouse". Most computers that are on the market these days operate in this way.<A

Finally Success with the Graphical User Interface</A>
</H3>
  The graphical user interface wasn't first seen in Apple's Macintosh. The first computer on the market with a graphical user interface was the Xerox Star in 1981. It was a failure. It was underpowered, slow and overpriced and Xerox never turned a profit from it but it had a great influence on other companies to push for the technology and Apple was one of them.<A
 HREF="#theFirstGUIs">()</A> <BR>
 Apple's first computer that had a graphical user interface was actually the Apple Lisa(named after Steve Jobs' daughter) in 1983. It was a commercial failure. They intended to sell it to businesses but they did not go for the Lisa because of its high price and they mostly decided to run less expensive IBM PCs, which were already beginning to dominate business desktop computing.<A
 HREF="#lisa">()</A>  Over 50,000 units were sold by April and an additional 200,000 were sold by the end of the year. <BR><BR>

<P>
The Macintosh&#226;&#128;&#153;s biggest selling point, which is still valid even today, was that it didn't require its user to learn lengthy instructions: &#226;&#128;&#156;Try the computer you already know how to use&#226;&#128;&#157; was a part of their advertisement.<A

Now let's take a look at the sales statistics. Since Apple incorperated breakthrough technology in their computers, like the graphical user interface we talked about previously, their strategy in the first few years was to demand a large price premium<A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="#foot152"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN></SUP></A> for their products. Despite this pricing strategy, the revenues and the market share company grew throughout the late 80s and the early 90s as seen below in the graph of the annual unit sales of the Macintosh.<A
 HREF="#appleMacSalesPaper">()</A>
<BR>
 From the year 1995 to 1998 Apple suffered from a plunge in revenues and market share and at the time this was expected to be fatal for the company. The reason for this fall was said to be because Apple didn't let any other company clone the Macintosh. It is speculated that if Apple had done this, it would have increased the popularity of the platform. Here is a profile of the company by a newspaper that points this out: <BR><BR>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit"> "If Apple had licensed Mac software to other computer makers in the late 1980s, it would have cut the generous gross margins the company enjoyed on Mac sales &#226;&#128;&#148; but it also would have created a huge market for cheap Mac clones, driving Apple&#226;&#128;&#153;s market share sharply higher and letting what nearly everyone agrees was a superior machine duke it out with the PC. For whatever reason &#226;&#128;&#148; arrogance, perfectionism, timidity, technical hurdles &#226;&#128;&#148; Apple never did that. Instead, dozens of PC clone makers made cheap machines and delivered the keys to the computing world to Microsoft. Apple, meanwhile, continued to talk about how it was creating a computer for &#226;&#128;&#156;the rest of us,&#226;&#128;&#157; even though that computer was much more expensive than the other choices the rest of us were offered"<A

After 2003, the Macintosh sales quickly picked up and and by the end of 2005, close to 8 million units were sold. Below we can see the graph for the growth of sales in Macintosh. From the year 1986 up until the mid 90s, the growth percentage is always positive. We can then see that the growth percentage went to minus during the years 1995 to 1998, the period we went over on the previous page. And again after 2003, the sales growth went up.<A

On the 23rd of October, only a month after the 9/11 attacks, Steve Jobs anounced the first iPod as "breakthrough digital device".

The iPhone</A>
</H2>
 In the year 2007, a new smartphone entered the market. Instead of the usual keypad, this phone had a touchscreen. It had computer-like capabilities that have never been seen on another device. The original iPhone did not have any third party apps, GPS, or video recording.

 After the success and acceptance the first iPhone received, what really made people see its potential was the model that came out in 2008. Along with this model they launched the App Store for the first time and it also supported 3G, a mobile communications standard that allowed mobile phones to access the internet much faster than before. <BR>
 After the 3G and the 3GS model(which was basically an upgraded version of the 3G model) came the iPhone 4. It had a newer, more modern design and its screen was much better than the previous models. It had the first ever Retina display. It was also the first iPhone to have a front facing camera. It can be said that this was the most significant model.<A
 HREF="#iphoneHistory">()</A><BR>
 As the years went by, each model after that came out was slightly better than the previous one and the iPhone slowly became the most popular smartphone series in the world along with Samsung. The one that most recently came out at the time of writing is the iPhone X, which is seen as the best smartphone on the market along with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.

The Economics of an iPhone</A>
</H3>
 With the release of the iPhone X with a price tag of $999, it has been the best selling iPhone so far. By 2018, the iPhone makes up approximately 60% of Apple's total revenue. This also makes Apple very dependent on the smartphone market. Below is a graph the shows how much revenue Apple has generated from the iPhone each year.

</DIV>

 So how does Apple generate such high revenues? They owe it largely to their sourcing model, where components and materials are gathered from around the world and sometimes even from direct competitors like Samsung. This significantly lowers capital expenses for the company.<BR>
 Now let's take a look at what it costs to produce a single unit. The iPhone 8 Plus model was priced at $799 at the time of release. The tech research company, IHS Markit, estimated the building cost of an iPhone 8 Plus as $288.08 without the marketing and research costs, broken down as:<BR>
<BR>
Apps Processor &#226;&#128;&#148; $27.50 <BR>
Baseband &#226;&#128;&#148; $33.90 <BR>
RF / PA &#226;&#128;&#148; $24.60 <BR>
Battery &#226;&#128;&#148; $4.45 <BR>
BT / WLAN &#226;&#128;&#148; $7.35 <BR>
Cameras &#226;&#128;&#148; $32.50 <BR>
Display &#226;&#128;&#148; $52.50 <BR>
(electro)mechanicals &#226;&#128;&#148; $50.95 <BR>
Memory &#226;&#128;&#148; $31.20 <BR>
Power Management &#226;&#128;&#148; $16.05 <BR>
User Interface  &#226;&#128;&#148; $11.28 <BR>
Sensors &#226;&#128;&#148; $6.65 <BR>
Box contents (headset, lightning cable etc.)  &#226;&#128;&#148; $11.80 <BR><BR>
 With the company making a $510.92 profit on each sale, this model alone grabbed 19.1% of the profit share in Q4 2017 as seen below.<A

Apple's Overall Effect on the Economy</A>
</H2>
 So far we have learned about and analyzed some of Apple's most significant products and the sale statistics and strategies of these products. In this section, we will take a look at Apple's impact on the economy as a whole. we'll see how Apple as a company has contributed to the economy and the job market.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00046100000000000000">
Job Creation</A>
</H3>
 Apple has a page on its website that gives details on its contributions on job creation in the market. According to their website, Apple is responsible for creating more than 2 million jobs in the USA. 80,000 of them being Apple employees, 450,000 of them being through US-based suppliers and 1,530,000 jobs related to the App Store ecosystem. Since the launch of the App Store in 2008, U.S. developers have earned over $16 billion in sales world wide.<A

Some Countries' Economies are tied to Apple</A>
</H3>
 According to  the International Monetary Fund, the fate of some national economies is intrinsically tied to the iPhone. <BR>
 In Ireland for example, where Apple's European operations headquarters are located, iPhone exports alone have contributed to nearly a quarter of the country's economic growth in the year 2017. <BR>
 There is also South Korea, where Apple suppliers like Samsung/LG are based. Semiconductor exports represent 17.1% of exports and this makes South Korea's economy dependent on how Apple does in the market.<A

iPhones Responsible for 10% of U.S. Economic Growth</A>
</H3>
 In late 2014, Forbes reported of a claim that Apple's iPhone 6 Plus sales were responsible for 10% of all US economic growth.<A
 HREF="#iphoneUSEconomy">()</A> Quoting an article about the situation, here is how they came to the conclusion: <BR><BR>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit"> Based on pure mathematical estimates of the productive value of all final American products, as well as the revenue generated from iPhone 6 sales, the Apple device was seemingly responsible for 0.25% or 0.3% of the change in the United States' GDP. On the surface, this meant iPhone 6 sales were 10 to 15% of conventional economic growth.<BR>
 GDP is actually a very rough, overly simplistic, and problematic estimate of growth. Moreover, revenue from iPhone sales is not the same as a domestic product from iPhone sales, since domestic product tries to capture value added, not just incoming dollars. Even if that statistic is wrong (which Forbes admits, it probably is), 10% is still an interesting figure to express how huge Apple's sales numbers were&#226;&#128;&#148;even back in 2014.<A

 Below are some figures on just how large Apple's market valuation is compared to the Gross Domestic Product of countries in 2016. It is almost as large as my country Turkey and even larger then some of the relatively wealthier countries such as Switzerland or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Conclusion</A>
</H1>
 Since its founding in 1977 up until today, Apple has been through a lot and has a very rich history. Though they had some very good ideas, ground-breaking innovations and top quality products, their business strategies and the way they marketed themselves made made all the difference. With the influence of great and creative minds such as Steve Jobs, they have managed to become one of the largest and most well known company in the world and have made an impact on countless people world wide.<BR>
 In this paper we took a look at various moments in Apple history and tried to analyze just what Apple did that brought them to success. We saw them take previously failed technologies and somehow push them to be mainstream like the graphical user interface with the Macintosh. We saw how a computer program exclusive to the Apple II, Visicalc, aside from helping Apple sell more products changed the way businesses viewed computers and even changed the job market and paved the way for the development of advanced statistics and artificial intelligence, which is currently one of the most important technologies in our era. We looked at how creating a product ecosystem with the iPod and the iTunes helped increase product sales drastically. We saw how iPhones made the economies of entire countries dependent on Apple and how Apple used a sourcing strategy to buy components and materials for their products from all around the world, even from rivals like Samsung or LG to reach a very high profit margin. We observed just how large Apple has become by making comparisons in GDP and growth not with other companies but with actual countries.<BR>
 I tried to cover as much as I could in the scope of this paper but the truth is Apple is a 42 year old company as of 2018 and there are still a lot of things we couldn't get into. Delving into some of the more critical moments I hope I have succeeded in showing some of the business strategies that have shaped Apple into the giant company that it is today. I have learned a lot about what it took and what decisions had to be made in order to make a company grow and I also learned a lot on how a company like Apple can have an impact on the various aspects of the economy, both on a local and a global level.
