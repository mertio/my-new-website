The Macintosh became one of Apple's best product lines. Above you can see the evolution of the Macintosh from the first one in 1984 to the present model.<A
 HREF="#macEvolution">()</A> With each model, the Macintosh, presently called Mac/iMac, has improved in design, size and CPU power. <BR>
In the graph below we can observe just how powerful the CPUs got with each model from 1984 up until 2013.<A
 HREF="#macCpuGrowth">()</A> Interestingly, when looking at this graph, we can loosely observe the famous Moore's Law<A NAME="tex2html11"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot264"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN></SUP></A> in action.

Now let's take a look at the sales statistics. Since Apple incorperated breakthrough technology in their computers, like the graphical user interface we talked about previously, their strategy in the first few years was to demand a large price premium<A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot152"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN></SUP></A> for their products. Despite this pricing strategy, the revenues and the market share company grew throughout the late 80s and the early 90s as seen below in the graph of the annual unit sales of the Macintosh.<A
 HREF="#appleMacSalesPaper">()</A>
<BR>
From the year 1995 to 1998 Apple suffered from a plunge in revenues and market share and at the time this was expected to be fatal for the company. The reason for this fall was said to be because Apple didn't let any other company clone the Macintosh. It is speculated that if Apple had done this, it would have increased the popularity of the platform. Here is a profile of the company by a newspaper that points this out: <BR>
<BR>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit"> "If Apple had licensed Mac software to other computer makers in the late 1980s, it would have cut the generous gross margins the company enjoyed on Mac sales &#226;&#128;&#148; but it also would have created a huge market for cheap Mac clones, driving Apple&#226;&#128;&#153;s market share sharply higher and letting what nearly everyone agrees was a superior machine duke it out with the PC. For whatever reason &#226;&#128;&#148; arrogance, perfectionism, timidity, technical hurdles &#226;&#128;&#148; Apple never did that. Instead, dozens of PC clone makers made cheap machines and delivered the keys to the computing world to Microsoft. Apple, meanwhile, continued to talk about how it was creating a computer for &#226;&#128;&#156;the rest of us,&#226;&#128;&#157; even though that computer was much more expensive than the other choices the rest of us were offered"<A

After 2003, the Macintosh sales quickly picked up and and by the end of 2005, close to 8 million units were sold. Below we can see the graph for the growth of sales in Macintosh. From the year 1986 up until the mid 90s, the growth percentage is always positive. We can then see that the growth percentage went to minus during the years 1995 to 1998, the period we went over on the previous page. And again after 2003, the sales growth went up.<A
 HREF="#macGrowth">()</A> Apple's Macintosh computer series is still alive and well even today at the time of writing (2018) with each model improving in design and technology and is expected to continue in the upcoming years.
