What is "Break It Down"?</A>
</H1>
 "Break It Down" is essentially a to-do list application with the tasks that need to be done appearing as floating balls on a screen. Depending on the importance of the task, we can select bigger or smaller sizes for the ball. Each task can have sub-tasks(sub-balls) and by clicking on a task and clicking its "See children" button, we can go to the sub-layer of the said task and see its sub-tasks. It is a pretty simple app but it has helped me break things down into smaller tasks easier than before. And development-wise it is the first online app I have ever developed and was very good practice for learning JavaFX and Spring. <BR>

 In the next few pages, we will look at some sample images of the application GUI and understand how it works. And then we will move on to the improvements made in security.
